## 📋 Backlog

### Sprint 17: GenAI Predictor Design (Next Major Phase)

**Goal**: Research and design the GenAI-based prediction engine using PBP data as primary source.

**Research Areas**:

- Transformer architectures for sports sequence data
- PBP tokenization strategy (events, time, scores as tokens)
- Embedding layer design for game state representation
- Training data preparation (sequence formatting)

### Future Enhancements

- **Historical Data Backfill**: PlayerBox/TeamBox (2000-2022, ~30K games), InjuryReports (Dec 2018-2023, ~900 PDFs/season)
- **Player Props Model**: Player-level predictions using PlayerBox data

## ✅ Completed Sprints

### Sprint 16b: Datetime & Timezone Overhaul (Dec 27, 2025)
**Summary**: Comprehensive datetime consistency across project with user timezone detection.

**Strategy**: "Store UTC, query in Eastern Time, display in user's local timezone"

**Changes**:
- Added central datetime utilities in `src/utils.py`:
  - `get_utc_now()` - timezone-aware UTC datetime
  - `get_current_eastern_datetime()` - NBA operating timezone
  - `get_current_eastern_date()` - for season/schedule operations
  - `utc_to_timezone()` - convert for user display
- Fixed `determine_current_season()` to use Eastern time for June 30 boundary
- Standardized all cache timestamps to UTC (features, players, injuries)
- Added browser timezone detection (JavaScript → Python)
- Fixed "Today/Tomorrow" display to use user's actual timezone
- Fixed timezone comparison error in injury data collection

**Testing**:
- Verified correct display for America/New_York, America/Los_Angeles, Europe/London
- Database quality validated for both DEV and CURRENT databases
- Update pipeline tested successfully with new UTC timestamps

### Sprint 16: Frontend API Optimization (Dec 25, 2025)
**Summary**: Comprehensive logging, query optimization, and live game status sync for frontend API.

**Performance Improvements**:
- Reduced page load from ~9s to <0.4s for 5 games (95%+ improvement)
- Query time per game: ~0.07s (down from ~1.5s)

**Logging Added**:
- `@log_execution_time` decorators on 5 functions:
  - `get_normal_data()` - main game data query
  - `load_current_game_data()` - predictions + game state query
  - `update_predictions()` - formula-based blending
  - `make_current_predictions()` - current predictions orchestration
  - `process_game_data()` - data transformation for display
- `[Frontend]` summary logging at INFO level:
  - Date requests: `[Frontend] 2025-01-15: 12 games | 1.23s`
  - Game ID requests: `[Frontend] 0022500012 | 0.45s`

**Query Optimizations**:
- Replaced correlated subquery with ROW_NUMBER() OVER pattern in CTE
- Separated PBP query from main query (avoids row multiplication)
- Limited PBP to 50 most recent plays per game (configurable)
- Added 3 database indexes:
  - `idx_gamestates_game_play` on GameStates(game_id, play_id DESC)
  - `idx_pbp_game_id` on PbP_Logs(game_id)
  - `idx_predictions_game_predictor` on Predictions(game_id, predictor)

**Architectural Changes**:
- Removed internal HTTP request in `app.py::get_game_data()`
- Now calls `get_games()` / `get_games_for_date()` directly
- Eliminated JSON serialization/deserialization overhead

**Live Game Status Fix**:
- Added `sync_live_game_status()` - syncs from NBA Scoreboard API (real-time)
- Fixed `save_schedule()` to never decrease status: `MAX(Games.status, excluded.status)`
- Schedule API returns stale status=1 for in-progress games; now properly preserved
- In-progress games now correctly fetch and display PBP data

**Testing**:
- Added 3 new tests for game_id path (valid, invalid, empty)
- Added empty game_id validation in `get_game_data()` route
- 23 API/schedule tests passing

### Sprint 15: Pipeline Optimization & Database Consolidation (Dec 19-25, 2025)

- Created compressed backup: 1.4GB (94% compression ratio)

**Schema Unification**:
