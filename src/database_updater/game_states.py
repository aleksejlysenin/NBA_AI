"""
game_states.py

This module processes NBA play-by-play data to create and save game states.
It consists of functions to:
- Create game states from play-by-play logs for multiple games.
- Save the created game states to a SQLite database.
- Ensure data integrity by handling errors and logging the status of operations.

Functions:
- create_game_states(games_info): Creates a dictionary of game states from play-by-play logs for multiple games.
- save_game_states(game_states, db_path): Saves the game states to the database and updates game data status.
- main(): Handles command-line arguments to fetch, save, and create game states, with optional timing.

Usage:
- Typically run as part of a larger data processing pipeline.
- Script can be run directly from the command line to fetch and save NBA play-by-play data, and create game states:
    python -m src.database_updater.game_states --save --game_ids=0042300401,0022300649 --log_level=DEBUG
- Successful execution will print the number of games processed, the number of game states created, and the first and last state of each game.

    Create a dictionary of game states from play-by-play logs for multiple games.

    Parameters:
